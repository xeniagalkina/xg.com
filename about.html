        <div class="about-container">
                <p style="margin-top: 100px;">I'm a student at <strong>Purdue University</strong>, studying Web Development & Design.
                     Originally from RUssia, I moved alone to Austria right after school and learn immigration the hard way. I've majored in Political Science with the focus on Helathcare and Technological Aspects. 
                     I started teaching myself Machine Learning during my studies and managed to get a first Data Science job after less than a year. 
                     Besides working full-time I am also taking courses in Masters Bioinformatics, where I do research in the field of Gerontology and Deep Learning. 
                     I am a leader of Data Science Community at the University of Vienna and an occasional public speaker.</p>

                <p>I love learning new things and i got very excited starting with a new topic! I prefer develop 
                        my own way and learning paths, focusing on solving problems and share then with others. 
                    While learning I enjoy documenting my journey and take aways
                    athat I can lately pack into a blog or a talk</p> 
                <p>AI is one of the most exciting things I have ever discovered for myself and I push myself to
                stay up to date on all new technologies and break-throuthgs in the field. I'm currently taking a course in <b>Deep Learning</b>
                to improve my skills and to expand from machine learning to deep neural networks.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of my studies and work I started a blog on Instagram called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xenia_vg/">AI Development</a>. I use 
                    this platform to connect with other developers, share tips, motivate others to start programing
                    and show that math and algroithms can be fun and easy.
                </p>
                <p>As this blog has continued to grow, I've decided to begin currating my own AI related tutorials and documentation which will soon be available at <a href="http://aiwithxenia.ai">aiwithxenia.ai</a></p>
                
                <p>I'm currently in the process of designing and developing an AI Academy based in Vienna, with potential expension. 
                This will be a completely new program fro anyone who is interested in learning and mastering skills for future ai development roles.
